Simulation Trucking Flow (Phyton-based)
-- Abstract of this research --
Efficient port logistics require robust strategies to manage some complex and uncertain constraints, including truck arrivals, limited service capacity, and evolving operational conditions. This paper presents a Bayesian queueing simulation framework that integrates probabilistic modelling and discrete-event simulation to evaluate truck congestion and service delays in container ports. We model the system as an M/M/c queue, where truck arrivals are treated as a Poisson process and service times are exponentially distributed across c parallel resources. By simulating 24-hour trucking activity and applying Bayesian updating for real-time arrival rate estimation, the framework adaptively identifies peak congestion periods and operational stress points. Performance metrics, including average waiting time, queue length, dock utilization rate and probability of congestion are assessed across four operational scenarios, including baseline flow, increased load, dock expansion, and scheduled downtime. The findings indicate that congestion is more sensitive to service capacity disruptions than to arrival rate fluctuations. The integration of stochastic modelling with adaptive response mechanisms enables more resilient and data-driven decision-making for port authorities. This simulation framework can be used to support strategic planning efforts by revealing critical temporal and operational bottlenecks, enabling ports to adjust dynamically to changing demand conditions and infrastructure constraints.
